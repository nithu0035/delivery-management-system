# Delivery Management System â€” Upgraded (Resume-ready)

This repo was programmatically upgraded by an assistant to include modern full-stack structure (Express + React),
authentication scaffold (JWT), Docker + docker-compose, CI, and basic tests and linting. Please review changes, run locally,
and edit environment variables in .env before deploying.

See UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md for details.
