# UPGRADE_SUMMARY

This repository was upgraded to be a resume-ready Delivery Management System.
Changes applied (best-effort, automated):

- Project restructured for Express + React full-stack.
- Added `server/` express structure with controllers, routes, services, and auth middleware (JWT).
- Added `client/` React + Tailwind starter (if none existed).
- Added Dockerfile and docker-compose for local development.
- Added basic GitHub Actions CI workflow (Node.js) to run lint and tests.
- Added ESLint + Prettier config and basic unit test examples.
- Created `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` with run instructions and checklist.
- Polished `README.md` (shell) with badges and instructions.

**Notes:** I updated code files in-place. Please run `npm install` in server/ and client/ (if present) and run the app locally.
